**How to Start Editing Schematics**
- Clone the "canhw" repo from https://github.com/waterloo-rocketry/canhw
- Enter canhw and make sure you are on the most up to date version of master branch
- Make sure that both the payload-2023-electrical and canhw repos are in the same parent directory! KiCAD will not be able to find our custom libraries otherwise
